## What is Know Your Government and why do I care?

2020 being the election year, I thought of making a tool, so that I can get to know about the American Politics. 
So **Know Your Government** is a modern android App, to explore the at present political leaders in your region. 
Not only in your region or county but any part of the entire United States. 
For any U.S. residential address, you can look up who represents that address at each elected level of government.

</p>

The App lets you enter an address to look up the corresponding district at each level of government and the names, address, contact
and social media properties for the elected officialModels in those districts.
